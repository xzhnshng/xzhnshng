### Hi, I'm Zhensheng!

I'm an incoming SDE at AWS, Seattle. I graduated from Duke U Computer Engineering in May 2022.

From March 2020 to April 2021, I worked at Bytedance as an SDE intern: developed Tiktok & Vigo applications and platform product server, and contributed to React component library. During May to August 2021, I worked as a software engineer intern at eBay: develped SellerHub (Java, SpringBoot) and analysize data with big data tools like Hadoop, ClickHouse and Spark.

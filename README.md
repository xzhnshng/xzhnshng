### Hi, I'm Alice!

I'm a developer and a graduate student studying Computer Engineering, interested in software design & development and its applications to social network, bioinformatics, finance, and other fields.

I am excited for learning new things and motivated to explore new techology at every moment. Currently, I focus on software engineering and big data.

From March 2020 to April 2021, I worked at Bytedance as an SDE intern: developed Tiktok & Vigo applications and platform product server, and contributed to React component library. During May to August 2021, I worked as a software engineer intern at eBay: develped SellerHub (Java, SpringBoot) and analysize data with big data tools like Hadoop, ClickHouse and Spark.

I will graduate from Duke University in May 2022 and go to Seattle!

### Hi, I'm Alice!

I'm a developer and a graduate student studying Computer Engineering, interested in software design & development and its applications to bioinformatics, finance, and other fields.

I am excited for learning new things and motivated to explore new techology at every moment. Currently, I focus on software engineering and big data.

From 2020 March to 2021 April, I worked at Bytedance as an SDE intern: developed Tiktok & Vigo applications and platform product server, and contributed to React component library.

I am currently a software engineering intern at eBay, on the Ads team.

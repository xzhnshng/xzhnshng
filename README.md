### Hi, I'm Alice!

I'm a developer and an MS studying Computer Engineering, interested in software design & development and its applications to bioinformatics, finance, and other fields.

I am excited for learning new things and motivated to explore at every moment. Currently, I focus on software engineering. For the past few years, I've been exploring on Reinforce Learning and Computer Vision; My final year project is on object detection: I created an multi-object classification modal using YOLOv2, v3 and proposed an optimized combination algorithm based on the granularity of the detected object.

From 2020 March to 2021 April, I worked at Bytedance as an SDE intern, developing Tiktok & Vigo applications and platform product server, and contributing to React component library.

I am currently a software engineering intern at eBay, on the Ads team.
